# Kokusen
Kokusen is a network scanning tool with some build in functions.

**1st run:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**2nd run:**

    python kokusen.py 

Some tools like SYN flooder need sudo permission to run because it uses RAW socket and SYN flooder is not working on windows.

If you figure out any bug please let me know.
